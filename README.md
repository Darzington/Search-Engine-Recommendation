# Search-Engine-Recommendation

The final version of the cumulative assignments from my Advanced Program Design with C++ course.

The assignment was done in 4 stages:

1- Word count program: Counts the occurances of each word over several documents, can choose to ignore stopwords (eg "the", "it", etc)

2- File indexer: Accepts a query from the user and finds the most similar files by cosine similarity between the query and file content

3- Essay Generator: Uses similar sentences from news articles to build an essay based on a user's question

4- Movie Recommender: Recommends a list of movies to a user based on their input of a movie they liked and on the plot summaries of over 40000 movies.

This was a 2-person group project done over September 2017 to November 2017 inclusive.
